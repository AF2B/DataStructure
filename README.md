## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the study and understanding of data structures. Each structure is explained in detail, with practical examples and use cases. Here, you will find not only implementations but also performance analysis and best practices for each data structure.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Lists are ordered collections of elements. In this repository, we explore:
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Circular Lists

### Stacks

Stacks follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. Here, we discuss:
- Implementations using arrays and linked lists
- Practical applications
- Complexity analysis

### Queues

Queues follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. We include:
- Simple Queues
- Priority Queues
- Circular Queues

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical structures. We study:
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- AVL Trees
- B-Trees

### Graphs

Graphs represent relationships between pairs of elements. We analyze:
- Representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Search algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)

### Hash Tables

Hash Tables are used for efficient key-value mapping. We cover:
- Hash functions
- Collision handling
- Applications

## Contributions
